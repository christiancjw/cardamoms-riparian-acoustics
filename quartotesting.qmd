# Site Based Analyses

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Setting up

```{R}
library(vegan)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(purrr)
library(readr)
library(tidyr)
```

## Setting in working directory and reading in function to extract files

```{R}
setwd("/Users/christianching/Documents/Projects/cardamoms-riparian-acoustics")

file_list <- list.files(path = ".", pattern = "Towsey.Acoustic.Indices.csv", 
                        recursive = TRUE, full.names = TRUE)


```

## Reading in csv files from Stung Ta Chey

```{R}


```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{R}
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
